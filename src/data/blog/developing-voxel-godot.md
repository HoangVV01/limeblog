## What made me pick Godot ?

When I was in my 7th semester, I had a class called PRU-211m and it was about building Unity games using C#. It was really a tough because there wasn't much guide. The team was a 5 person team but I was the only one working on it.
I noticed how heavy Unity is over time and with frequent updates its hard to know when its stable.
And so I wanted to pick sth less complicated easy to learn and fast, customizeable. Thats where Godot is powerful. Its open source lightweight and easy to pick up

## The tutorial that was used as the scaffold
