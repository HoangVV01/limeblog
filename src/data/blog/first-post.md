## Background

Being bad at logic and time management, I took a few gap semesters to retry the remaining subjects. It was mentally draining. My program if on time could have ended on June 2024 but extended to July 2025.

Within 2021 - 2024 I basically only followed only what the school taught me so my base knowledge was never enough to real work.

Knowing the language itself doesn't change anything. And the way things were taught didn't seem to be effective. 

The worst thing I kinda regret is not going to the library to have a more focused environment. Staying at the dormitory was a bad idea.

## Goals

Being someone very lost in the field, knowing only little of everything nothing seems to be clear. I didn't have a proper goal so I only learn sth that I had interest in.
Theres a fine line between those who can code and those who only know how to copy someone elses work, read already made code. Coding has always been the easy part, problem solving is the hard part in which theres not much "challenge" if you just wanna pass a subject

Because I've spent most of the time in school learning web thats what I followed. But what I didn't know is the lack of up to date stuff that I had to look up online. No place can provide you all the tools you need, you need to find them yourself.
